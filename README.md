## Project Introduction
BiliAgent is a complex AI Agent application built on large models. This tool receives user input on the web front-end, and the back-end calls the Bilibili API in real time. Based on the user's input, it queries real-time data, autonomously conducts data analysis, and generates precise responses or data analysis reports, which are then returned to the user through the front-end. For example, users can request:
- I am learning about deploying the Chat GLM model. Please find the most positively reviewed relevant videos and return the links along with your recommendations.
- I am preparing to release a video about Swarm technology. Please generate a trending title based on current popular video titles and descriptions to help me gain more attention.

## Core Technology

**In terms of project architecture**, BiliAgent is an end-to-end service using a front-end/back-end separation architecture. The backend combines LangServe and FastAPI technologies, utilizing the LangServe's `add_routes` interface to encapsulate chains and RAG services from LangChain into REST APIs. It supports high-concurrency requests, streaming, and asynchronous operations. The frontend is built with Streamlit, focusing on simple user interaction rather than complex visual presentation. **In terms of technology application**, the core AI Agent framework is provided by LangGraph, and the basic model invocation is done through LangChain, supporting the most popular GPT series (international) and GLM4 models (domestic).
